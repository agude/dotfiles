# Filing Guide

For detailed filing decisions, consult the flowchart in the JDex:

```
~/Documents/00-09 System/00 System/00.00 JDex for System/flowchart.md
```

## Quick Decision Tree

1. **About a specific person?** → `10-19 Personal` under their folder
2. **About yourself specifically?** → `11 Self`
3. **A bill to pay?** → `27 Bills and Reimbursements`
4. **Major asset (home, car)?** → `30-39 Home and Property`
5. **Job/career/education?** → `40-49 Career and Education`
6. **Hobby or creative project?** → `60-69 Hobbies and Recreation`
7. **Household service/utility?** → `80-89 Household and Services`
8. **Reference material?** → `90-99 Reference`

## Common Gotchas

- **Personal health records** → Person's folder (e.g., `12.50`), not `50-59 Health`
- **House fixtures** (HVAC manual) → With the house in `31.XX`
- **Standalone appliances** → `93 Manuals and Documentation`
- **Photos as memories** → `Pictures` folder (outside JD)
- **Photos for projects** → `63 Creative Works`
