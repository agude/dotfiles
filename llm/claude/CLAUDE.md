## Commit Style

**Commits**: Always use `git secure-commit` instead of `git commit`.

**Format:**
```text
Short imperative headline (50 chars)

Detailed body explaining *what* and *why*.

Changes:
- Specific change 1.
- Specific change 2.
```
**Rule:** Use imperative mood ("Refactor" not "Refactored").

When I say "Amend" or similar, I mean "squash the current changes into the
previous commit, and rewrite the message".
